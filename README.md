Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is to design, develop, test and maintain a software system. It enables the creation of software applications and system that power various aspects.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Structured programming emerged in the late 1960s as a response to the challenges of managing increasingly complex software systems.
Object-Oriented Programming became popular in the 1980s as a new paradigm for software design and development.
Agile methodologies were formally introduced in 2001 with the publication of the Agile Manifesto, which emphasized iterative development, collaboration, and flexibility over traditional, rigid project management practices like the Waterfall model.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Design - structure out the problem and computerize it
Develop - develop the solution using computer technology 
Test - test if the solution is working 
Deploy - enables you to work with it 
Maintenance - future improvement and adjustment to the program 

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is a linear, sequential process ideal for projects with stable, well-understood requirements and a need for thorough documentation, such as government contracts or simple internal tools. Its structured approach makes it predictable but inflexible, with late-stage testing that can lead to costly rework. In contrast, Agile is iterative and highly flexible, accommodating changing requirements through continuous user feedback and frequent software deliveries. Itâ€™s well-suited for complex, evolving projects like startup products or large enterprise systems, though it can be less predictable and requires skilled teams to manage potential scope creep.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer focuses on writing and maintaining code, implementing designs, and ensuring the software functions correctly. A Quality Assurance Engineer is responsible for testing the software, identifying defects, and ensuring it meets quality standards. A Project Manager oversees the entire project, coordinating the team, managing resources, and ensuring that the project is completed on time, within budget, and to the required quality standards.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs enhance developer productivity by providing an all-in-one environment for coding, debugging, and testing eg visual studio, while VCSs facilitate collaboration, track changes, and support continuous integration and deployment eg Git.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Software engineers face several common challenges, including requirement changes, technical debt, debugging issues, and keeping up with rapid technological advancements. To overcome these, strategies include adopting Agile methodologies for flexibility, implementing automated testing and regular refactoring to manage technical debt, using advanced debugging tools, and engaging in continuous learning

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing focuses on individual components, detecting bugs early.
Integration Testing ensures that combined components work together correctly.
System Testing validates the complete system against requirements, assessing overall functionality.
Acceptance Testing confirms that the software meets business needs and is ready for release.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering involves designing precise inputs to effectively interact with AI models, ensuring they generate accurate and relevant responses. It is important for maximizing model performance, reducing ambiguity, enhancing user experience, supporting complex tasks, and optimizing resource use.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
A vague prompt like "Tell me about the economy" can be improved by specifying details, such as "Explain how inflation affects consumer purchasing power in the Uganda economy in 2020." The improved prompt is more effective because it provides clarity on the topic, specificity in the context and timeframe, and conciseness, guiding the AI to deliver a precise and relevant response
